# Machine_Translation

## Neural Machine Translation System

Machine translation is a challenging task that traditionally involves large statistical models developed using highly sophisticated linguistic knowledge.

Neural machine translation is the use of deep neural networks for the problem of machine translation.

## German to English Translation Dataset

we will use a dataset of German to English terms used as the basis for flashcards for language learning.

The dataset is available from the ManyThings.org website, with examples drawn from the Tatoeba Project. The dataset is comprised of German phrases and their English counterparts and is intended to be used with the Anki flashcard software.

You will have a file called deu.txt that contains 152,820 pairs of English to German phases, one pair per line with a tab separating the language

We will frame the prediction problem as given a sequence of words in German as input, translate or predict the sequence of words in English.

This Project is divided into 4 parts; they are:

>German to English Translation Dataset
>Preparing the Text Data
>Train Neural Translation Model
>Evaluate Neural Translation Model
